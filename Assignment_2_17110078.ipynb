the world trade organization.nafta was the worst trade deal in history, and china’s entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.it was bill clinton who

terrible agreement.then, as secretary of state, hillary clinton stood by idly while china cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.the city of pittsburgh, and the state of pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the clintons put china into the wto.fifty thousand factories across america have shut their doors in that time.almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with china.it was also hillary clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with south korea in 2012.as reported by the economic policy institute in may, this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 american jobs.as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton “voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.”trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.to understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product.from 1947 to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.however, since 2002 –
